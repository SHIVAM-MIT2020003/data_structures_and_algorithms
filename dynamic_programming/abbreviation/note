Logic -

I treat each character of string a as person.
Capital letter represents a person who is more powerful and have some pride on him that why always come with wrong(FALSE) value and no one can remove him.
Small letter represents a person who is less powerful and alway comproise with his neighbour.

Now lets start a story.
Example a: daBcd
        b: ABC

There is a Area named DP of size 5 + 1 X 3 + 1 where 6 is width and 4 is height.
First d came with false value because he don;t know anything about that area soon he relized that he had to convert himself as his neighbour since
he didn't have any neighour so he convert himselft as right person(TRUE).




//come to the point

2 thing we need to concern in order to solve this problem

1. If a[i] in capital letter it come with false value and if a[i] match with b[j] then it check dp[i - 1][j - 1] to make sure every thing is fine till know
2. If a[i] is smaller letter it check from to just previous character everything is fine or not if yes then store true and if a[i] was matched with then it would be valent good and store true again.
