This problem can be solved using modified DFS.
(backtracking)
Solution -
1. perform dfs by considering each vertex as a starting vertex.
2. while performing dfs we must maintain two arrays one for marking visited
   nodes and other arrays used to verify whether current is present in stack or not.
3. conditions
    A. vertex[i] == false && hasCycle(...)(do for each adjacent vertex of i)
    B. when node i is visited then you will have to check whether that perticular
    node is present in stack or not if yes then return true otherwise return false.
